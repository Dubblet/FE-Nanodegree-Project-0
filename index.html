                <p class="iama">Why I'm here...</p>
                <p class="my-info">After graduating high school, I tried many different classes, and bounced between subjects, trying to decide what I wanted to pursue for a living.
                  Unfortunately, I was plagued for years with motivation issues, which caused me to struggle in many classes. After deciding that maybe college wasn't for me, I wanted to look
                  for other options.<br>This past summer, I've looked into teaching myself some programming, which eventually lead me here, to Udacity. I'm hoping to learn a lot!</p>
                <p class="iama">If you want to know more...</p>
                <p class="my-info">Hello! I am 23 years old, and have lived in Howell, Michigan my whole life. It's kind of in the middle of the state, and I love travelling to lake Michigan in
                  the Summer.<br>I am a Christian, and my relationship with Christ is very important to me. God has always been a part of my life. I've been swing dancing on and off at casual groups
                  for about 5 years now, I've even helped run some of the clubs and events.<br>I've been with my wonderful girlfriend, Jennifer, for 2 and a half years now. We actaully met at a
                  swing dancing group, so we love dancing together! I love to laugh, and make other people laugh too.<br>I have always really enjoyed video games. They have always been my favorite
                  thing to do for fun. I quite enjoy getting together with friends to play some board and card games as well! I think someday it would be awesome to be able to work on a team and
                  actually make a video game.<br>I am currently working at my church part time, as a janitor/maintenance worker.
